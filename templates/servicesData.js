    title : 'Routesetting for new gyms',
    description : 'Everybody knows that opening a gym is far from easy and fast work. There are many decisions that should be taken in advanced. And when you can feel that the finish is near and soon you will enjoy the crowded gym, comes the routes. To set so many routes on a big new wall, in all range of categories is not an easy job. Here also many things should be planned in advance, such as whether a cherry picker can reach all parts of the wall and can be borrowed or the routesetting should be done only by rope. How many holds should be needed and so long. This is why we are here to help. We have worked under plenty of different circumstances and have developed experience and professional attitude for the job. We can discuss what is best for your situations and make an action plan. So do not hesitate to contact us!',
