RouteSetting site deployment

Routesetting is the activity of creating climbing routes. As a climber i love and enjoy doing it, so the idea was born when i decided that i can expand my passion. 
This is a deployment (only front-end) which is another idea after course in JS applications in SoftUni. So the smartest thing i could do i to combine my passions and
create my first project to be in real use. The lack of back-end make it only modern business card, but i love what happend and motivated about development and new 
ideas! 

For the deployment used lit-html templating library from npm and also page.js about routing the single app view. 
Added 404 file to redirect users, because git hub pages does not support single page views. Glad i found help about 404.
